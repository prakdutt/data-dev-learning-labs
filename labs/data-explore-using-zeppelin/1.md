# **Interactively Static (csv) Data Explore using Zeppelin**

# **Lab Overview**

Interactive browser-based notebooks enable data engineers, data analysts and data scientists to be more productive by developing, organizing, executing, and sharing data code and visualizing results without referring to the command line or knowing the cluster details. Notebooks allow users to not only execute but also interactively work with long workflows. Zeppelin provides a &quot;Modern Data Science Studio&quot; that supports Spark and Hive out of the box. In addition, Zeppelin supports multiple languages in back-end, with a growing ecosystem of data sources. Zeppelin notebooks provide interactive snippet-at-time experiences to data scientists.

In this lab we see how to do Interactive static data explore with zeppelin.

## **Lab Objectives**

- Learn to interactively analyze Big Data by using Zeppelin
- Explore the way to read &amp; format (csv) HDFS files by using Spark
- Learn how to save DataFrame into a temporary SQL table for consequent queries
- Explore interactive SQL analysis and visualization on tables in Zeppelin

## **Prerequisites**

- Studied platform user guide
- Basic knowledge of zeppelin
- Basic programming skill of Spark (e.g. scala, RDD, DataFrame, SparlSQL, etc.)
- Basic understanding of SQL queries
- Chrome Browser.

## Step 1: Explore DLP Platform

DLP website URL ([link](https://developer.cisco.com/))

[http://10.10.10.74/DDPDevUI/demo/#/ddp/login]

1. From DLP home page, click Drill to choose interactive analysis environment.
2. In the popup frame with Zeppelin and Jupyter as options, click Zeppelin.
3. Follow the pop-out chrome page to begin the interactive analysis and visualization using Zeppelin

## Step 2: Develop in Zeppelin notebook

1. On the Zeppelin homepage, create your own notebook by click on &quot;Create new note&quot;.
![Figure](https://github.com/prakdutt/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/welcome-to-zeppelin.png?raw=true)

2. Create and name your new notebook in the pop up dialog.

3. In your newly created notebook, a typical Zeppelin interactive development and visualization working environment.

Note: You can use the top-right tool buttons do corresponding configurations (e.g., set paragraph width, copy visual report link, etc.) when necessary

## Step 4: Data Refine
 - Coding in Spark to
-    a.	Read in the DLP public available file - bank-full.csv - from HDFS
-    b.	Remove the header using filter function, and transform data from csv format into RDD of Bank objects
-    c.	Convert RDD to DataFrame and create temporary table with name “bank”
![alt-tag](https://github.com/prakdutt/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/BankFull.PNG?raw=true)
N.B: Bank Full csv is ready placed in HDFS. User can use this file for further process. 

val bankText = sc.textFile("hdfs://xx.xx.xx.xx:xxxx/yourPath/bank/bank-full.csv")  

case class Bank(age:Integer, job:String, marital : String, education : String, balance : Integer)

// split each line, filter out header (starts with "age"), and map it into Bank case class
```jason 
val bank = bankText.map(s=>s.split(";")).filter(s=>s(0)!="\"age\"").map(  
       s=>Bank(s(0).toInt, 
            s(1).replaceAll("\"", ""),  
            s(2).replaceAll("\"", ""),  
            s(3).replaceAll("\"", ""),  
            s(5).replaceAll("\"", "").toInt  
        )  
)
```
## Step 4: Data Retrieval

Suppose we want to see age distribution from bank. To do this, run:

**%sql**** select **age,** count**(1)**from **bank** where **age** &lt; **30** group ****by** age **order**** by** age

You can make input box for setting age condition by replacing 30 with ${maxAge=30}.

**%sql**** select **age,** count**(1)**from **bank** where **age** &lt; **${maxAge** = **30}** group ****by** age **order**** by** age

Now we want to see age distribution with certain marital status and add combo box to select marital status. Run:

**%sql**** select **age,** count**(1)**from **bank** where **marital** = **&quot;${marital=single,single|divorced|married}&quot;** group ****by** age **order**** by** age

By running the above paragraphs of SQL queries, you will get corresponding visual result like below:

![Figure](/posts/files/data-explore-using-zeppelin/assets/sql-results.png)

 **Things to Try**

- Try with different queries.
- Try with inner queries.

From this we have learned how to use the Zeppelin with different types of SQL queries.
