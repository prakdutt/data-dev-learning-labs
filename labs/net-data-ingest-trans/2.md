1. cd target to view the package
1. Enter the command below to run your job

`HADOOP_USER_NAME=dev_1 spark-submit –master yarn –deploy-mode cluster –class TransformData /projects/spark-transform/target/transform-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-depencies.jar parameter1 parameter2 parameter3`

`parameter1`: the data file on the hdfs we need to transform.
`parameter2`: the path of the output; a folder will be created automatically after the job is done.
`parameter3`: the name of the output file.

Example:
